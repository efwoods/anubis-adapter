"""Auto-discovered signature key phrases.

VENDORED from the main Anubis API
(``anubis/src/anubis/utils/dataset/key_phrases.py``); only the internal import
paths were changed. Keep the discovery and occurrence-rate computations
identical to the source when updating.

Key phrases are the surviving key-phrase signal from
``features/statistical_significance.md``. The character n-gram and function-word
vectors that used to live here alongside them were dropped (they were
capture-only and never scored); the key-phrase signal is now used two ways:

* as the scalar ``key_phrase_rate`` in the fixed Mahalanobis vector of
  :mod:`src.anubis.utils.dataset.style_features` (via
  :func:`key_phrase_occurrence_rate`), and
* as a separately-stored, separately prompt-injected list of the avatar's
  signature phrases.

Two public functions:

* :func:`discover_key_phrases` — over a corpus of the target's direct quotes,
  finds recurring multi-word expressions (2–4 words) that are OVER-REPRESENTED
  relative to a generic-English baseline. The score is a keyness ratio: the
  phrase's observed relative frequency in the corpus divided by the frequency a
  generic English writer would produce by chaining the same words INDEPENDENTLY
  (the product of the words' generic unigram frequencies). Because fixed
  collocations ("you know", "got it", "what do ya mean") recur far more than
  independence predicts, they rise to the top — which is exactly the behaviour
  asked for. This is a pointwise-mutual-information keyness against a bundled
  generic baseline, so it needs no corpus download and is fully deterministic.

* :func:`key_phrase_occurrence_rate` — given a text and a set of already-
  discovered phrases, counts how many times those phrases occur (as contiguous
  token runs) per total word. This is the scalar the avatar's ``key_phrase_rate``
  feature is built from, so it tokenises with the SAME :func:`tokenize` the
  discovery step uses to keep the two consistent.
